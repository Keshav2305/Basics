# Basics
A code explaining the basics of cpp programming language
## Aim
To learn about the basics of cpp programming
## Theory
C++ is a super of C language. C++ is an object oriented lanugage that is widely regarded as the best language for large scale applications.

Cpp supports a wide variety od data types and the programmer can choose which data type is required for his application:
1. Primary or Build in data types:
 Integer type, Floating value, Double, Character ,String etc
2. Derived Data types:
 Arrays, Pointers etc
3. User defined data types:
 Classes, Structures etc

Before starting our main code we include some header files. For example #include<iostream> which is a basic input output headrer file, we also include the namespace 'std'.

Some basic input output syntax are: 
To take input: ``` cin>>variable_name; ```
To give output: ``` cout<<variable_name;```
## Explaination
This is a basic program that has some variables that have values already initialized and some declared variables getting a value later on. We are taking input and printing that input.
The line ```sizeof(variable_name)``` Tells us the size of the varible in bytes.
